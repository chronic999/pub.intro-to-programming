// Objects and properties

// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#objects_and_properties

// A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object.

// Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects.

// The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.

// You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:

// Syntax: objectName.propertyName

const myCar = {
  make: "Ford",
  model: "Mustang",
  year: 1969,
};
console.log(myCar.make);
console.log(myCar.model);
console.log(myCar.year);
